  <!-- I was very hesitant to take the Intoduction to Programming Nanodegre
since I am an Accountant by trade but I did start out in Computer Progarm back
in 1994.-->
<!-- I am a very logical person and I was very good in Math and love working with
Databases and the Internet so I figured I would give the degree a try. Also I
think this degree will further enhance my skills to help my group move forward
into the new world of AT&T 2020-->

  <h1>Thinking like a Programmer</h1>

  <b>Procedural Thinking</b>
  <p>Part of the <em>long-term memory</em> that is responsible for knowing who to do things.
    Often referred to as <em>Motor Skills</em>, it's the memories stored information on
    how to do things. Super Procedural Thinkers have a <em>superior ability</em>
    to form procedural memories and are very logical in their thinking which 
    can assist becoming a better Programmer

  <b>HTML</b>
  <p><em>Hypertext Markup Language or HTML</em> was invented in the 1990s and is used for
    tagging text files on the <em>World Wide Web <b>(eg. WWW)</b></em>. HTML is used to define
    fonts, color, graphic and hyperlinks.<a href = "https//m.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/">

  <b>Computers Are Stupid</b>
  <p> I remember from my initial programming days <em> GIGO or Garbage In 
  Garbage Out </em>. Basically a Computer <b>(CPU)</b> is going to do exactly what you
  tell it to do. Coding is very exact almost like a Science. If you miss one 
  character or letter the CPU may not understand the command hence display
  <em>Garbage</em> as the output.
